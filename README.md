# Employee-Attrition

## Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition data for a fictional company. The dataset has been processed in SQL to create a structured database for efficient management and analysis.


## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: ([Employee Analysis | Attrition Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/hr-employee-attrition/data)). 
A SQL database was created using DDL, with key columns loaded from a .csv file to support focused analysis on attrition factors.

## Analysis
The analysis focuses on identifying key factors contributing to employee attrition, including relationships between attrition rates and variables such as monthly salary, job satisfaction, age, work-life balance, and department. Using SQL, insights were generated to highlight patterns and identify high-risk groups, providing a foundation for targeted retention strategies.
